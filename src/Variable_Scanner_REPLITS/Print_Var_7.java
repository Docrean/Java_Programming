/*
* ## Given two String variables **`topic1`** and **`topic2`** with values (from Scanner), write a statement to display the topics we will learn as a full sentence:

```
I will learn $topic1 and $topic2 at Cydeo.
```

**Note:** You don't need to do anything with the Scanner.  Use the variable as done before.

Main topics: print statement, variables, String, concatenation, Scanner, escape characters

```
Ex:

  Input:
    Java
    SQL

  Output:
    I will learn "Java" and "SQL" at Cydeo.
