/*
### Given two int variables **`first`** and **`second`** with values (from Scanner), write a statement that will print the values in a single line. See the example below.

**Note:** You don't need to do anything with the Scanner.  Use the variable as done before.

```
Ex:
  Input:
    55
    123

  Output:
    first is 55 and second is 123
```
```
Ex:
  Input:
    -124
    -500

  Output:
    first is -124 and second is -500
```
