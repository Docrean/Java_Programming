        how to swap a with b and b with a without a third variable(c) as medium for switch?
        1. Computer first needs sum of a as a + b which is 25
                                a = a + b = 25
        2. Find b by - new sum of a
                    b = 25 - 15 = 10
        3. b is now switched to original a (10) as wanted
                    now how to get a switched to original b?
        4. take new sum of a(25) - b(10) = 15!
        5. Now a = b and b = a!
